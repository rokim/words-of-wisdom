Just a shared (yet unordered) collection of wisdom/quotes and principles I like and try to live by.

## Quotes
### Give credit
> Give credit. The more you give, the more you receive.

_Prof. Klaus Diepold (TU Munich) in Computer Science for Engineers_

It's about honest, positive feedback to others around you. Your family, friends, colleagues or even strangers you witness doing a great job. Don't use it inflationary. Mean what you say and be grateful. 

### Owning things
> The things you own end up owning you.

_Tyler Durden in Fight Club_

Don't identify yourself to the things you own. Your self-worth is more than that. Try to free yourself from the weight of unnecessary things you own. They just take your valuable time (and money) which you could spend on something far more important. Yourself and others. Love people and use things because the opposite never works.

### Break the system
> If you can't beat the system, break it.

_Malcolm in Malcolm in the Middle S03E02_

This quote is altered to its imperative form.

## Principles
### Shuhari (Kanji: 守破離)
* shu (守) "obey" — **Follow** the instructions of one master precisely (fundamentals, techniques, heuristics, proverbs). Don't worry about the underlying theroy. 
* ha (破) "detach" — **Branch out**, learn the underlying principles and theory. Start learning from other masters and integrate that additional knowledge into your practice. 
* ri (離) "separate" — No conscious thought, everything is natural. You aren't learning from others, but from your own practice. **Create** your own path and approaches. 

To gain knowledge and learn something new, you have to pass these three stages. Don't make the common mistake to think you could jump directly into the ri-stage. It takes a lot of time - often years - to get there.

### Making mistakes
> To make mistakes is human. To own your mistakes is divine. Nothing elevates a person higher than quickly admitting and taking personal responsibility for the mistakes you make and then fixing them fairly. If you mess up, fess up. It’s astounding how powerful this ownership is.

_Kevin Kelly in [68 Bits of Unsolicited Advice](https://kk.org/thetechnium/68-bits-of-unsolicited-advice/)_

Additionally, try building up a solid base of trust for you and the others around you, to make this work. 

### Simplicity
Simplicity is key in almost any field in our daily life. Strive for a simple solution to a problem. [Simple, correct, fast: in that order](https://drewdevault.com/2018/07/09/Simple-correct-fast.html). Try to explain a subject - especially if it is complex - in a simple way.
